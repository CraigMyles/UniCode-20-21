## :clipboard:  How it works?

• 84 University Teams
• Spread over 6 leagues
• Battle head-to-head for points
• Win awesome prizes
• Get noticed by top brands

## :red_car:  How Long is it?

There is a total of 13 challenges to complete,  each one taking no more than an hour to complete. 
A challenge is open for 2 weeks and only your first submission will count for scoring.

## :rocket:  How you win?

Each coder can contribute points towards their University by completing a challenge. 
The team with the highest points  (taken from the top 10 individual scores) will win the fixture and obtain 3 points.

## :trophy: The Grande Finale

The top 10 coders from each of the 5 Universities in each league will battle it out in the Unicode 20/21 Grand Finale to claim top spot.
Don’t worry, you can still qualify for the individual finale if your team doesn’t make it
